Hello all C++ programmers and all olympiad programmers.  
Here're my old solutions to timus online judge platform tasks sorted by task number.  
The time I was solving it I just started to learn C++, but nonetheless tried my best to solve it in the most efficient and neat way.  
I'd like you to comment on this repo, share your opinion and give me advices on how to make my code cleaner and more beautiful ^-^
